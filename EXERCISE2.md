# 2. Use the Red Green Refactor workflow to implement a solution

There is a class in `./src/main/java/com.booleanuk/code/CohortManager.java` and a test class in `./src/test/java/com.booleanuk/core/CohortManagerTest.java`. Your morning teacher will demonstrate the process of creating tests from the domain model below, and then using those tests to develop robust source code.

This is known as the **Red, Green, Refactor** workflow; an important discipline to practice. Simple to learn yet difficult to master.

When writing software using this Test Driven Development approach, we don't write a complete test or complete method at a time. We write *just enough* of a test for it to fail, then write *just enough* source code to make the test pass, then refactor until the test fails and repeat this cycle.

What we are creating here are known as *unit tests*, tests that verify a single unit of our application is working correctly. They should be as small as possible, usually broken down into three parts:

1. Setup
2. Execute
3. Verify

Here's some pseudo-code to show the structure of a unit test:
```
shouldSayHello() {
    // 1. Set up
    speaker = new Speaker();
    name = "Nathan";
    
    // 2. Execute
    message = speaker.sayHello(name)
    
    // 3. Verify
    assertEquals("Hello, Nathan!", message)
}
```

### Domain model for demonstration

```
As a user,
So I can find a specific cohort,
I want to search a list of all cohorts by a cohort name.
```

| Classes         | Methods                                     | Scenario               | Outputs |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| `CohortManager` | `search(List<String> cohorts, String name)` | If name is in list     | true    |
|                 |                                             | If name is not in list | false   |

### Exercise

**NOTE: Create new classes in the `./src/main/java/com.booleanuk/core/` directory**

**NOTE: Create new test classes in the `./src/test/java/com.booleanuk/core/` directory**

- Use the Red, Green, Refactor approach to create a solution for the following domain model
- It's normal for this practice to feel difficult or frustrating in the beginning

```
As a supermarket shopper,
So that I can restock my cupboards,
I want to add products into my basket.

As a supermarket shopper,
So that I can pay for products at checkout,
I'd like to be able to know the total cost of items in my basket.
```

| Classes  | Members                                                            | Methods                          | Scenario                                                   | Outputs |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `Basket` | `HashMap<String, int> items` (key is product name, value is price) | `add(String product, int price)` | Item with the provided name *is not* already in the basket | true    |
|          |                                                                    |                                  | Item with the provided name *is* already in the basket     | false   |
|          |                                                                    | `total()`                        |                                                            | int     |
